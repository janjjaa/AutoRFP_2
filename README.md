## AutoRFP

Final project for the Building AI course.

## Summary
AI-powered Automatic RFP Completion for Sales Teams. An AI tool that solves the time-consuming and repetitive task of completing Request for Proposal (RFP) forms, which are commonly used by sales teams in the process of responding to bids for software and delivery services

## Background
The problem that AutoRFP seeks to solve is the time-consuming and repetitive task of completing Request for Proposal (RFP) forms, which are commonly used by sales teams in the process of responding to bids for software and delivery services. RFPs often contain hundreds of fields asking for specific business, technical, financial, and legal information, and although many questions are repetitive across different RFPs, each document is unique in its own structure and requirements. The manual effort involved in completing these forms can be tedious and error-prone, slowing down the process and causing delays in responding to potential customers.

This is a common problem for many sales teams, especially in industries where multiple RFPs need to be answered on a monthly or even weekly basis. The personal motivation behind this project is to help alleviate this burden on sales teams, providing them with a more efficient way to respond to RFPs without compromising the quality and precision of their answers. The topic is important as it directly impacts a sales team's ability to win contracts and close deals faster, thus accelerating the sales cycle and improving business outcomes.

## Data and AI Techniques
The project would rely on two primary data sources:

1. Internal company documents: These would include past RFP responses, proposals, and any other business-specific data that has been used to respond to previous RFPs.
2. RFP templates: A variety of RFP forms that the company typically handles would be analyzed to understand their structure, fields, and common variations.

AI techniques that could be applied include:

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** This would be used to extract relevant data from past responses and RFP documents. Techniques like Named Entity Recognition (NER) would help identify business-specific information, such as pricing, services, timelines, and technical specifications.
****Text Classification and Matching:** These methods would help match past responses to corresponding RFP questions. This classification process could identify the most appropriate pre-written answers from the company's database, based on the similarities between previous responses and the current RFP.
**Text Generation with Large Language Models (LLMs):** Tools like ChatGPT or GPT-based models could be used to generate or suggest responses to open-ended questions. These models could be fine-tuned on company-specific data to ensure relevance and accuracy in their responses.
**Integration with Cloud Services:** Solutions like Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud AI could be used for scalable processing, making it possible to handle large RFPs and streamline the entire process.

A demo could be implemented where the AI system would automatically extract relevant information from a set of company documents and apply it to a new RFP form, filling out common fields and generating text for open-ended questions.

## How It Is Used?
The solution would be used primarily by sales teams who are tasked with completing RFPs. After uploading an RFP document into the system, the AI would analyze the structure of the form and pre-fill the common fields with data from previous proposals or internal documents. For open-ended questions, the system could generate responses based on historical information, saving time and reducing the manual effort involved. Sales representatives would then only need to review, adjust, and customize the answers as needed before submitting the RFP.

The affected individuals would include sales representatives, sales managers, and business development teams. The AI solution would allow them to focus on higher-value tasks such as strategy, customer interaction, and deal closing, instead of spending significant time on repetitive administrative work. It would also enable a quicker response time to RFPs, which is crucial in competitive markets.

## Challenges
The solution would not fully eliminate the need for human involvement, particularly for highly customized RFP questions or specific requirements that go beyond common fields. In some cases, the AI-generated answers may still need to be fine-tuned to ensure they align perfectly with the customer's expectations. Additionally, the AI may not be able to handle situations where the company data is incomplete or outdated. The solution could also face limitations when dealing with RFPs that are highly complex or require nuanced answers that cannot be automatically generated.

## What Next
The project could evolve by integrating feedback from users to improve the AIâ€™s ability to suggest and generate more accurate and relevant answers over time. Additionally, future iterations could incorporate more advanced AI techniques, such as sentiment analysis or context-aware responses, to tailor the answers even further to the needs of the potential customer. Collaboration tools could also be added to the platform, allowing teams to work together and make real-time edits to the generated responses before submitting the RFP.
